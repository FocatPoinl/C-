The Whole story could be different if we had chosen CDMA2000 besides WCDMA ... all bands together, the 128 randominc spreaded codes woud be multipled as 6 if a data banda of 10MB was desingned at once because we already was surround by AP doing that... And we could already have a 10MB Band 15 years 14 ago with litle gaps 1.25MB, huge gaps for IOT, called NArrow bands... and we should keep it an hibrid plataform of PDC the best Japan which was better and similar to GSM and was a mother of Internet unlimited and always delivering throuput and international roaming since 2003... since this point... Fortgot all because the 4g and 5g kick off goes to germany because the are associated whit a company who projects better e faster technologies...

I just read books and keep looking to the measuring equipments... diagrams and constelations....
